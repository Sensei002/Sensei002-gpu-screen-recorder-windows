# Functional Parity Matrix — Linux Upstream vs Windows Port

Status legend:

* **FULL** — implemented with equivalent behavior.
* **PARTIAL** — implemented with a documented difference.
* **WINDOWS-SPECIFIC** — Windows-only behavior added where the platform
  requires it (no upstream equivalent).
* **NOT POSSIBLE** — no faithful Windows equivalent; feature is hidden with a
  clear error (never faked).
* **TODO** — planned, not yet implemented.

This matrix is a living document; Phase 16 (parity testing) drives every row
to a final status. `PLANNED` rows below reflect the architecture in
`docs/architecture.md`.

## Explicitly out of scope (never implemented)

* Telemetry, analytics, ads, accounts, cloud dependency.
* Electron/WebView/React/Next.js UI.
* OBS dependency.
* Kernel drivers, DLL injection, anti-cheat bypass.
* Any "inspired-by" rebranding — the project keeps its upstream identity.
