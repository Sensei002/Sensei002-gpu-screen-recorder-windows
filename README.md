# GPU Screen Recorder — Windows Port

A native Windows x64 port of the original **GPU Screen Recorder** project by
[dec05eba](https://git.dec05eba.com/gpu-screen-recorder/) — a screen recorder
with minimal system impact that records using the GPU only, similar to NVIDIA
ShadowPlay. This is **not** a new or "inspired-by" recorder: it is a genuine
platform port that preserves the upstream architecture, UI, UX, behavior, CLI
and project identity, and replaces only the Linux-specific platform layer
with native Windows implementations.

> **Status: Phase 1 (upstream analysis) complete.** See
> [docs/implementation-roadmap.md](docs/implementation-roadmap.md) for the
> phase plan. Nothing is built locally — all compilation, testing, packaging
> and releasing happens in GitHub Actions (see
> [.github/workflows/windows-release.yml](.github/workflows/windows-release.yml)).

## What this is

* **Engine** (`gpu-screen-recorder.exe`) — the recording daemon: monitor /
  window capture, GPU encoding, instant replay, screenshots, streaming, CLI +
  IPC control. Port of upstream `gpu-screen-recorder` 6.0.0 (r1467/d31b698).
* **UI** (`gsr-ui.exe`, `gsr-ui-cli.exe`) — the ShadowPlay-style fullscreen
  overlay UI. Port of upstream `gpu-screen-recorder-ui` 1.13.5 (r720/edfc70d),
  including its custom OpenGL widget stack (mgl/mglpp).
* **Notification** (`gsr-notification.exe`) — the ShadowPlay-style
  notification overlay (upstream `gsr-notify`, renamed for Windows).
* The upstream GTK frontend (`gpu-screen-recorder-gtk`) is deprecated upstream
  and superseded by the UI; it is not ported (see
  [docs/windows-port-parity.md](docs/windows-port-parity.md)).

## Platform replacements at a glance

| Linux | Windows |
|---|---|
| X11 / Wayland / DRM-KMS capture | Windows Graphics Capture (primary) + DXGI Desktop Duplication (fallback) |
| VAAPI / Vulkan encoders | NVENC (NVIDIA), AMF (AMD), QSV (Intel), software fallback — all via FFmpeg |
| PulseAudio / PipeWire | WASAPI (loopback + capture) |
| POSIX signals / unix sockets | named events + named-pipe IPC (same JSON protocol) |
| systemd / XDG autostart | HKCU Run / Startup folder |
| mgl X11/Wayland windowing | mgl Win32 backend |
| evdev/uinput global hotkeys | RegisterHotKey / Raw Input |

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full design and
[docs/windows-port-parity.md](docs/windows-port-parity.md) for the
feature-by-feature status matrix.
